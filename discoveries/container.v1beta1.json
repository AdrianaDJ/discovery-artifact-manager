For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an \"rmdir\" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.

Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you'd use something like: ``` start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR ``` Windows can span multiple days.
