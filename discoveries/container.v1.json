For example, to have something repeat every weekday, you'd use: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` To repeat some window daily (equivalent to the DailyMaintenanceWindow): `FREQ=DAILY` For the first weekend of every month: `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU` This specifies how frequently the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window every weekday, you'd use something like: ``` start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400 recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR ``` Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: ``` start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA ``` Note the start and end time's specific dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window and when it first starts.
